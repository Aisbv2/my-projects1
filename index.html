A <b>design</b> is a plan or specification for the construction of an object or system or for the implementation of an activity or process, or the result of that plan or specification in the form of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype">prototype</a> , product or process. The verb to design expresses the process of developing a design. In some cases, the direct construction of an object without an explicit prior plan (such as in craftwork, some engineering, coding, and graphic design) may also be considered to be a design activity. The design usually has to satisfy certain goals and constraints, may take into account aesthetic, functional, economic, or socio-political considerations, and is expected to interact with a certain environment. Major examples of designs include architectural blueprints, engineering drawings, business processes, circuit diagrams, and

The person who produces a design is called a designer, which is a term generally used for people who work professionally in one of the various design areas—usually specifying which area is being dealt with (such as a

A designer's sequence of activities is called a design process, possibly using design methods. The process of creating a design can be brief (a quick sketch) or lengthy and complicated, involving considerable research, negotiation, reflection, modeling, interactive adjustment and re-design.</p>

<h1>Design as a process</h1>
<h3><strong>The rational model</strong></h3>

<p>The rational model was independently developed by Herbert A. Simon,[8][9] an American scientist, and two German engineering design theorists, Gerhard Pahl and Wolfgang Beitz.[10] It posits that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Designers attempt to optimize a design candidate for known constraints and objectives.</li>
<li>The design process is plan-driven.</li>
<li>The design process is understood in terms of a discrete sequence of stages.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rational model is based on a rationalist philosophy[4] and underlies the waterfall model,[11] systems development life cycle,[12] and much of the engineering design literature.[13] According to the rationalist philosophy, design is informed by research and knowledge in a predictable and controlled manner.</p>
<h3><strong>Example sequence of stages</strong></h3>
<p>Typical stages consistent with the rational model include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-production design</li>
</ul>
<dl><ul>
<dd><li>Design brief or Parti pris – an early (often the beginning) statement of design goa</li>Analysis – analysis of current design goals</li>
<li>Research – investigating similar design solutions in the field or related topics</li>
<li>Specification – specifying requirements of a design solution for a product (product design specification)[14] or service.</li>
<li>Problem solving – conceptualizing and documenting design solutions</li>
<li>Presentation – presenting design solutions</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Design during production</li>
</ul>
<dl><ul>
<dd><li>Development – continuation and improvement of a designed solution</li>
<li>Testing – in situ testing of a designed solution</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Post-production design feedback for future designs</li>
</ul>
<dl><ul>
<dd><li>Implementation – introducing the designed solution into the environment</li>
<li>Evaluation and conclusion – summary of process and results, including constructive criticism and suggestions for future improvements</li></dd>
<li>Redesign – any or all stages in the design process repeated (with corrections made) at any time before, during, or after production.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each stage has many associated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice">best practice</a></p>
<h4>Criticism of the rational model</h4>
<p>The rational model has been widely criticized on two primary grounds:</p>
<ol><dl>
<dd><li>Designers do not work this way – extensive empirical evidence has demonstrated that designers do not act as the rational model suggests.[5][6][16]</li>
<li>Unrealistic assumptions – goals are often unknown when a design project begins, and the requirements and constraints continue to change.[4][17]</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>The action-centric model</strong></h3>
<p>The action-centric perspective is a label
 
given to a collection of interrelated concepts, which are antithetical to the rational model.[6] It posits that:</p>
<dl><ol>
<dd><li>Designers use creativity and emotion to generate design candidates.</li>
<li>The design process is improvised.</li>
<li>No universal sequence of stages is apparent – analysis, design and implementation are contemporary and inextricably linked.[6]</li>
</ol>
<p>The action-centric perspective is based on an empiricist philosophy and broadly consistent with the agile approach[18] and a methodical development.[19] Substantial empirical evidence supports the veracity of this perspective in describing the actions of real designers.[16] Like the rational model, the action-centric model sees design as informed by research and knowledge. However, research and knowledge are brought into the design process through the judgment and common sense of designers – by designers "thinking on their feet" – more than through the predictable and controlled process stipulated by the rational model.</p>
<h2>Philosophies of design</h2>
<hr>
<p>Philosophy of design is the study of definitions of design, and the assumptions, foundations, and implications of design. There are also countless informal or personal philosophies for guiding design as design values and its accompanying aspects within modern design vary, both between different schools of thought[which?] and among practicing designers.[22] Design philosophies are usually for determining design goals. In this sense, design philosophies are fundamental guiding principles that dictate how a designer approaches his/her practice. For example, reflections on material culture and environmental concerns (sustainable design) can guide a design philosophy.</p>
<h3>Approaches to design</h3>
<p>A design approach is a general philosophy that may or may not include a guide for specific methods. Some are to guide the overall goal of the design. Other approaches are to guide the tendencies of the designer.</p>
<p>Some of these approaches include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical design uses designed artifacts as an embodied critique or commentary on existing values, morals, and practices in a culture.</li>
<li>Participatory Design (originally co-operative design, now often co-design) is the practice of collective creativity to design, attempting to actively involve all stakeholders (e.g. employees, partners, customers, citizens, end users) in the design process to help ensure the result meets their needs and is usable.[23]</li>
<li>Scientific design refers to industrialised design based on scientific knowledge.[24] Science can be used to study the effects and need for a potential or existing product in general and to design products that are based on scientific knowledge. For instance, a scientific design of face masks for COVID-19 mitigation may be based on investigations of filtration performance, mitigation performance,[25][26] thermal comfort, biodegradability and flow resistance.[27][28]</li>
<li>Service design designing or organizing the experience around a product and the service associated with a product's use.</li>
<li>Sociotechnical system design, a philosophy and tools for participative designing of work arrangements and supporting processes – for organizational purpose, quality, safety, economics and customer requirements in core work processes, the quality of peoples experience at work and the needs of society</li>
<li>Transgenerational design, the practice of making products and environments compatible with those physical and sensory impairments associated with human aging and which limit major activities of daily living.</li>
<li>User-centered design, which focuses on the needs, wants, and limitations of the end user of the designed artifact.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types</h2>
<hr>
<sup><p>Design can broadly be applied to various fields such as art, engineering and production.</p></sup>

<h2>Design and art</h2>
<p>Today, the term design is generally used for what was formerly called the applied arts. The new term, for a very old thing, was perhaps initiated by Raymond Loewy and teachings at the Bauhaus and Ulm School of Design in Germany during the 20th century.
</br><br>
The boundaries between art and design are blurred, largely due to a range of applications both for the term 'art' and the term 'design'. Applied arts can include industrial design, graphic design, fashion design, and the decorative arts which traditionally includes craft objects. In graphic arts (2D image making that ranges from photography to illustration), the distinction is often made between fine art and commercial art, based on the context within which the work is produced and how it is traded.</br>
<br>
Some methods for creating work, such as employing intuition, are shared across the disciplines within the applied arts and fine art. Mark Getlein, writer, suggests the principles of design are "almost instinctive", "built-in", "natural", and part of "our sense of 'rightness'."[29] However, the intended application and context of the resulting works will vary greatly.</p>

<h2>Design and engineering</h2>
<p>In engineering, design is a component of the process. Many overlapping methods and processes can be seen when comparing Product design, Industrial design and Engineering. The American Heritage Dictionary defines design as: "To conceive or fashion in the mind; invent," and "To formulate a plan", and defines engineering as: "The application of scientific and mathematical principles to practical ends such as the design, manufacture, and operation of efficient and economical structures, machines, processes, and systems.".[30][31] Both are forms of problem-solving with a defined distinction being the application of "scientific and mathematical principles". The increasingly scientific focus of engineering in practice, however, has raised the importance of more new "human-centered" fields of design.[32] How much science is applied in a design is a question of what is considered "science". Along with the question of what is considered science, there is social
